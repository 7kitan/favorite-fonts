# favorite-fonts
Fonts I personally use for writing, and also web frontends

## MONOSPACE
- Jetbrains Mono - my go to, works really good in 600 weight + -0.45 px letter-spacing
- Maple Mono - comfy
- Berkeley Mono - retro and cool
- Commit Mono - utility, invisible, useful

## SANS SERIF
- Atkinson Hyperlegible - High legibility, utility font
- UD Digi # NK-R - Used for Japanese, and also very cute interface
- Open Sans / Fira Sans - Open Sans is really good for clear UI. Fira Sans for an also clear but more condensed look, which is great on vertical phone views.
- Museo Sans - Museum display type font. Recommended by actual museum workers.
- Source Sans Pro - used by the US government websites. 
- Metropolis - free Gotham alternative, really good for UI and album jackets
- Trebuchet MS - Tried web font, universally available, best out of the set for me
- Same with Verdana...

## SERIF
- Tiempos Text Regular - really similar to font used on Claude AI.
- Selectric Century - Digitisation of the Century font. Gives an even older feeling.
- Century Schoolbook - Used for Textbooks back in the day, really readable. Selectric is bolder though.
